### Summary

Currently, the workflow assumes that the **renv** project is activated by the `.Rprofile` hook (i.e., the R terminal starts up and sources `renv/activate.R`). While this is generally true, there are cases where it might fail—especially when the repository has been cloned onto a new computer and the project's libraries haven't been set up yet.

### Proposal

1. Add logic to check if we are in an **renv** project at runtime:
   - If **interactive**:
     - Prompt the user to activate the project (`renv::activate()`) if it isn’t already active.
   - If **non-interactive**:
     - Assume it’s okay to activate the project silently and proceed.

2. Document this behavior clearly for users in the relevant project documentation.

### Benefits

This approach improves robustness by:
- Ensuring the correct environment is set up consistently.
- Avoiding failures due to missing project activation, especially in new setups.
- Aligning behavior between interactive and non-interactive sessions for better compatibility.

### Next Steps
- Implement the activation-checking logic.
- Update project documentation to explain how activation is handled.
